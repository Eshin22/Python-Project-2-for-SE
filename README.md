# Jumpy Square (Debug Challenge)

This is a simple Pygame project designed with **logical bugs**.

1. Run the game using `python game.py`
2. Observe the behavior:
   - The square does not jump properly.

   - The square jumps when space is pressed.
   - It comes back down and lands properly.
   - Tests pass successfully.

- Python 3.x
- pygame
